<details> <!-- lingua franca? -->
  <summary>What is "lingua franca"?</summary>
  <p>
  It is a language widely utilized for communication between individuals even
  not using it natively, thus also exerting an influence on the whole landscape.
  For natural languages examples include Latin for medieval Europe, Chinese
  for East Asia, or English for world trade today. Similarly, C has been
  an inspiration for many other languages, and is the most common target
  for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">FFI</a>.

<details> <!-- logo? -->
  <summary>What is the correct C logo?</summary>
  <p class="anchor-no-color">
  Traditionally the logo of C language is uppercase letter 'C' in font
  <i>Helvetica Black</i> and color around
  <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadet_grey">Cadet Grey</a></i>,
  <i><a href="https://color-register.org/color/hit-grey">Hit Grey</a></i>
  and <i><a href="https://encycolorpedia.com/b0c4de">LightSteelBlue</a></i>.<br>
  As seen on the cover of <i>The C Programming Language</i> (K&amp;R).

<details> <!-- FAQ vs c-faq.org? -->
  <summary>Isn't this FAQ missing content?</summary>
  <p>
  Yes and no.
  </p>
  <p>
  There already are great FAQ lists (see <a href="resources">resources</a>)
  driven by the community, like famous <a href="https://c-faq.com/">clc FAQ</a>.
  <br>
  The committee also already has
  <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects#DRs">Change and Clarification Requests</a>
  documents.
  </p>
  <p>
  This FAQ, rather than being a language reference, aims to answer simple
  questions that don't really fit anywhere else.

<details> <!-- C++ superset? -->
  <summary>Is C++ a superset of C?</summary>
  <p>
  Not really, C++ is a <b>fork</b> of C.
  <br>
  To be precise it forked around <span class="nobr">K&amp;R C</span>,
  with C89, C90 and C95 merged almost fully, and truly started diverging
  from "mainline" with C99 and <span class="nobr">C++98</span>.
  <br>
  That being said, it was never a strict superset, as there always
  was valid C that would be invalid or differently behaving C++.

<details> <!-- C18? -->
  <summary>What is C18?</summary>
  <p>
  "C18" is a misnomer caused by the late publication of the C17 making the
  official long name of the standard <i>ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:20<b>18</b></i>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Similarly, ISO/IEC 9899:2024 should be referred to as "C23".
  </p>
</details>
<details> <!-- C95? -->
  <summary>Shouldn't C95 be "C94"?</summary>
  <p>
  There are even documents referring to it as "C93",
  but seems like the community settled on "C95".
