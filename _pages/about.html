C was designed by <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/">Dennis Ritchie</a>
during the early 1970s at <span class="nobr">Bell Labs</span> as an improvement
upon its interpreted predecessor: B language. After the release of Unix operating
system, and later also publication of the first edition of the bestseller book
<i>The C Programming Language</i>, authored by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/">Brian Kernighan</a>
together with Ritchie (K&amp;R), C became one of the most widely used programming
languages in the world, with implementations for practically all architectures and systems.

<h3>Standardization</h3>
<p style="text-wrap:initial">
The first standardization of the C language happened under
<a href="https://www.ansi.org/">American National Standards Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>
The current copyright holder of the C standard is
<a href="https://www.iso.org/">International Organization for Standardization</a> and the
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html">work on the project</a>
is overseen by working group <b class="nobr">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14</b>, commonly referred to as <i>C committee</i>.
</p>
<p style="text-align:initial">
The principles guiding the Committee in its efforts are outlined in the document
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3280.htm">The C Standard charter</a>.
