C was designed by <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/">Dennis Ritchie</a>
during the early 1970s at Bell&nbsp;Labs as an improvement upon the B language created
by Ken Thompson. After the release of the Unix operating system, and later also
publication of the first edition of the bestseller <i>The C Programming Language</i>,
authored by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/">Brian Kernighan</a> together
with Ritchie (K&amp;R), C became one of the most widely used programming languages
in the world.

Although its development began on the Unix operating system for the PDP-11
computer, C has since been implemented for practically all devices and
systems in the world. It is of fundamental importance for many aspects
of computing and data processing. It serves as a lingua franca to translate
between various systems and languages. C is often used as a target language
for compilers, as an implementation language for interpreters, for building
operating systems, for embedded programming, for teaching fundamentals of
computing, and for general purpose programming. It stands out in terms of
portability, interoperability, efficiency, and stability.

<h3>Standardization</h3>
<p>
After the book, the first official standardization effort
was led by X3J11 Technical Committee under project 381-D
by <a href="https://www.ansi.org/">ANSI</a> on Computers
and Information Processing (X3).
</p>
<p>
The current copyright holder of the C standard is <a href="https://www.iso.org/">ISO</a>, and
the <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html">work on the project</a>
is overseen by working group <b class="nobr">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14</b>.
</p>
<p>
The principles guiding the committee in its efforts are outlined in the document
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3280.htm">The C Standard charter</a>.
