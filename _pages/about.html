C was designed by <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/">Dennis Ritchie</a>
during the early 1970s at <span class="nobr">Bell Labs</span> as an improvement upon the
B language by Ken Thompson. After the release of the Unix operating system, and later also
publication of the first edition of the bestseller book <i>The C Programming Language</i>,
authored by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/">Brian Kernighan</a> together
with Ritchie (K&amp;R), C became one of the most widely used programming languages
in the world, with implementations for practically all architectures and systems.

<h3>Standardization</h3>
<p>
After the book, the first official standardization effort
was led by X3J1I Technical Committee under project 381-D
by <a href="https://www.ansi.org/">ANSI</a> on Computers
and Information Processing (X3).
</p>
<p>
The current copyright holder of the C standard is <a href="https://www.iso.org/">ISO</a> and
the <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html">work on the project</a>
is overseen by working group <b class="nobr">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14</b>.
</p>
<p>
The principles guiding the committee in its efforts are outlined in the document
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3280.htm">The C Standard charter</a>.
