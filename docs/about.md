# About

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    puts("hello, world");
    return 0;
}
```

C was designed by [Dennis Ritchie](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/) during the early 1970s at Bell Labs as an improvement upon the B language created by Ken Thompson. After the release of the Unix operating system, and later also publication of the first edition of the bestseller *The C Programming Language*, authored by [Brian Kernighan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/) together with Ritchie (K&R), C became one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

Although its development began on the Unix operating system for the PDP-11 computer, C has since been implemented for practically all devices and systems in the world. It is of fundamental importance for many aspects of computing and data processing. It serves as a lingua franca to translate between various systems and languages. C is often used as a target language for compilers, as an implementation language for interpreters, for building operating systems, for embedded programming, for teaching fundamentals of computing, and for general purpose programming. It stands out in terms of portability, interoperability, efficiency, and stability.

### Standardization

After the book, the first official standardization effort was led by X3J11 Technical Committee under project 381-D by [ANSI](https://www.ansi.org/) on Computers and Information Processing (X3).

The current copyright holder of the C standard is [ISO](https://www.iso.org/), and the [work on the project](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html) is overseen by working group **<span class="nobr">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14</span>**.

The principles guiding the committee in its efforts are outlined in the document [The C Standard charter](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3280.htm).
